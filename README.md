Where all the learning happens.

These files contain a lot of solutions to competitive programming problems solved by me. Feel free to look at/use them.

**Includes problems from:**
* Kattis
* Firecode.io
* HackerRank
* Will add some codefights later

**Also contains some useful resources (some are by me, some are not):**
* Data structures help
* Understanding Decorators
* Genetic Algorithms
* Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn, Tensorflow, and Neural Nets
* MIT Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms course work
* Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This repo gets updated regularly, as it is my main repo for doing any sort of experimentation, competitive programming problems, etc.
Good luck!
