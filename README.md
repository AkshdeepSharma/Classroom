Where all the learning happens.

These files contain a lot of solutions to competitive programming problems solved by me. Feel free to look at/use them.

**Includes problems from:**
* Kattis
* Firecode.io
* HackerRank
* Elements of Programming Interviews in Python

**Also contains some useful resources (some are by me, some are not):**
* Data structures help
* Understanding Decorators
* MIT Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms course work
* Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This repo gets updated regularly, as it is my main repo for doing any sort of experimentation, competitive programming problems, etc.
Good luck and I hope you find value in it!
